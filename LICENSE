    of the Product, and/or for any copies of any substantial portions of the
    Product, in the manner specified by the Creator.

      in such a way that the modified Product can then be considered a new

the intellectual property solely of the Creator and of no other party,

licenses thereof. Such intellectual property falls under § 5.1 of this License.


5: THE RIGHTS OF THE CREATOR AND FURTHER LICENSORS
 1. The Creator reserves no rights to any previously-established intellectual
    property which is implicitly or explicitly owned by any other entity or
    entities.
   a. If any such intellectual property is contained within or bundled
      alongside the Product, or is otherwise distributed with or appears

    legal documents (collectively, "Fair Use Laws"):
   a. Amendment I of the United States Constitution.

    License are not legally recognized or do not apply to the Compensation
    request, the Creator agrees to pay the owner of the disputed intellectual
    property a sum which equals the proportion of the prevalence that the
    disputed intellectual property maintains in the Product out of the total
    sum of profits garnered by the Creator for creating the Product.

    the Creator's discretion.
