Hello, all. This is an article concerning the decennial redistricting of the United States Congressional Districts, whose members make up the House of Representatives. This process involves all 50 states in the United States going through their own process to pass new congressional district boundaries in accordance with law. This redistricting must be done due to the results of the decennial census, and so redistricting occurs one to two years after the census takes place. The current redistricting cycle is taking place in 2021 and will continue through 2022 using 2020 US Census data so the districts may be ready for the 2022 midterms and legally go into effect in 2023.

This process can be lengthy and confusing, so here are a few guides: [the US Census’s definition of congressional districts](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/congressional-dist.html), [the Brennan Center for Justice’s guide to redistricting in all 50 states](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/50-state-guide-redistricting), and [the Loyola Law School’s All About Redistricting page](https://redistricting.lls.edu/).

To begin with, here is a map of the previous decade’s congressional districts as they are during the 117th Congress. Some states had further court-ordered redistricting since 2013, but I simplified here.

As of {{ page.date-edit | date: "%B %e, %Y"}}, here is where redistricting for the United States House of Representatives stands. Six states (Alaska, Delaware, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming) have at-large districts and so do not have a Congressional redistricting process. The other 44 will finish their processes by the 2022 midterm elections.
