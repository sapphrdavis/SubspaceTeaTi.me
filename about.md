I'm Sapph Davis, also known on the internet as ToixStory and Witch0Winter, and this is my website. I'm a writer, cartographer, and general fan of history and literature from Texas, where I have spent most of my life, and I currently reside in Colorado. I spend most of my free time working on various projects related to history and literature: most often in the form of short stories, novels, and maps.

I have, in my short career as a writer and cartographer ,won several awards, including the Turtledove Award for my writing and Map of the Month for cartography, and have had my work featured on [the Youtube series "The Great War"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51FXgQOoppw) [more than once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yQjHeT-34), the popular website [Alternate History Weekly Update](http://alternatehistoryweeklyupdate.blogspot.com/search/label/Lynn%20Davis), in [Medium](https://medium.com/@Bytor/theres-more-to-alternate-history-than-world-war-2-95eb73a7fd48#.giofpw607), and at the [University of Cambridge](http://www.toixstory.com/2016/09/my-work-at-university-of-cambridge.html). I have been interviewed for [Alternate History Weekly Update](http://alternatehistoryweeklyupdate.blogspot.com/2015/04/interview-lynn-davis.html) and [Odyssey Online](http://theodysseyonline.com/college-william-mary/an-interview-with-lynn-davis-alternate-cartographer/416195) and have [written a guest article for Alternate History Weekly Update](http://alternatehistoryweeklyupdate.blogspot.com/2016/09/fantastic-maps-and-where-to-find-them.html). I am also supported in my creative endeavors by donors on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/Witch0Winter) and [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/sapphdavis), which are linked in the sidebar.

I absolutely love what I do and use this website to reflect all of my creative endeavors, whether artistic or literary. My ultimate goal is for this website to become the one single place to find and access, for free, all the creative content I put out, and to access it here before anyone else and in a better-looking format than other websites like deviantArt, Twitter, or Facebook. I am an avid believer in using the internet to distribute free works done from passion and love of the subject and will use this website toward that end, so that my works will always be on display for anyone who wishes to see.

Thank you for visiting my site and I hope you enjoy your stay.
